## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

This was my first independent project. The biggest challenge I faced was positioning the footer at the bottom of the page. I learned how to properly structure a page layout using Flexbox to achieve this effect.

### Continued development

In the future, I would like to create full websites, both frontend and backend, to build more advanced and functional applications.
